# Procedural Dungeon Generator
Procedural Dungeon Genmeration Algorithm in JS

Based in the Gamsustra article: [Procedural Dungeon Generation Algorithm](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AAdonaac/20150903/252889/Procedural_Dungeon_Generation_Algorithm.php), based also on a post from the [TinyKeep](http://store.steampowered.com/app/278620/TinyKeep/) developers ( [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/) )

All the bad practices / bugs / and missconceptions are by myself, sorry in advance ;)

# Requirements
For the drawing I use a tiny JS library of myself called [Canvaz](https://github.com/carloscabo/canvaz). Its a HTML5 Canvas wrapper with some tools.

# How to use
Coming soon.
